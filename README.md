# WT_Project1
creating memory match game

Create a game with a grid of cards, each with a hidden image or symbol. The user clicks on two cards at a time to try and find matching pairs. Keep track of the number of attempts and the time taken.
Core JS Concepts: Arrays, shuffling (algorithm required), event listeners, conditional statements, DOM manipulation (showing/hiding card content, disabling clicks).
